# Section III: Section Three Name Here

[TODO: FPE: Please update with a short overview of this section. Don't list the chapters as we used to do in previous books. The chapter listings in a section will be auto-generated. This page should contain 1-2 paragraphs, not more, summarizing what the reader will learn and do. This is the intro to the next section of the book, so make it interesting!]

EXAMPLE BELOW. PLEASE DELETE EXAMPLE WHEN COMPLETED

Sumerian provides many tools to create rich 3D experiences. From an easy-to use-3D editor to an easy-to-understand visual scripting engine, Sumerian has everything you need to build unique scenes. 

In this section, you’ll cut your teeth on Sumerian by building an escape room. An escape room is a room filled with puzzles that you must solve to escape. Over the next eight chapters, these puzzles will each highlight a different aspect of the engine to give you an overview of what’s possible with Sumerian. These chapters assume that you have no programming or 3D development experience. They’ll walk you through the whole process, from creating a new Amazon account to enjoying your published your scene.
